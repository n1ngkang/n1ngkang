### 🛠️ What I do
My work focuses on transforming fragmented, manual data processes into automated and scalable systems:

* **⚡ Performance & Scale**: Specializing in overcoming platform limitations (e.g., GAS 6-min timeout) using **Asynchronous Trigger Chaining** and **Batch Processing** for large-scale datasets.
* **🔗 Cross-Platform Integration**: Seamlessly linking **Python (Pandas)** for heavy data lifting with **Google Cloud/GAS** for cloud-native automation and UI interaction.
* **🛡️ Data Integrity & Governance**: Designing multi-layered verification engines that resolve discrepancies and implement **Secure Credential Management** (Clasp/Script Properties).

### 🏆 Featured Projects

* **[Contracts Checking Tool](https://github.com/n1ngkang/Contract-Check-Tool)**: Developed an automated audit engine with multi-layered verification logic to detect complex RSV/Deposit billing discrepancies. Integrated a custom HTML5 sidebar for real-time error visualization and one-click data navigation, achieving a 90%+ boost in auditing efficiency.

* **[Customer Info Automated Update Engine](https://github.com/n1ngkang/Customer-Information-Automated-Updates)**: Engineered a hybrid Python-GAS pipeline to automate complex customer data reconciliation. Integrated Python (Pandas) for heavy data mapping with GAS for cloud-native triggers, incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" review system to ensure 100% data fidelity for sensitive updates.
